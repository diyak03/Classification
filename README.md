# Clustering
This repository is where all my clustering projects will be stored, I will have my project as well as the data used in my repository.

## Project 1 -- Clustering - Clustering Customers Using K-Means: A Data-Driven Approach
### Purpose:
One of my favourite things to do is to see if there are any hidden patterns when studying humans and human behaviour. One of the most popular ways to do that is consumer insights, so in this project I used K means to cluster bank customers based on their attributes, resulting in the creation of meaningful and distinct groups. Its always so cool to see emerging patterns in places you didn't expect! 

if you would like to see my power BI dashboard presenting the clusters and how they interact with the attributes they are in the file: https://github.com/diyak03/Clustering/blob/main/Project%202%20analysis%20(1).pbix
